# screenshot_url
Docker container that returns a screenshot of a web page as a jpeg. 

I originally made this so that a slackbot could call it and return screenshots of sites I can't reach over the public internet.
Or so that I could set some alert that when triggered, ran the container and emailed me the screenshot.
